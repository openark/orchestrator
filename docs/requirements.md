# Requirements

`orchestrator` is a standalone application. When configured to run with a `MySQL` backend, a MySQL installation is required. When configured to run with a `SQLite` backend, no further dependency is required.

`orchestrator` is built and tested on Linux 64bit and Mac OS/X. Official binaries are available for Linux only.
