  Relocate a replica beneath another (destination) instance. The choice of destination is almost arbitrary;
  it must not be a child/descendant of the instance, but otherwise it can be anywhere, and can be a normal replica
  or a binlog server. Orchestrator will choose the best course of action to relocate the replica.
  No action taken when destination instance cannot act as main (e.g. has no binary logs, is of incompatible version, incompatible binlog format etc.)
  Examples:

  orchestrator -c relocate -i replica.to.relocate.com -d instance.that.becomes.its.main

  orchestrator -c relocate -d destination.instance.that.becomes.its.main
      -i not given, implicitly assumed local hostname

  `
	CommandHelp["relocate-replicas"] = `
  Relocates all or part of the replicas of a given instance under another (destination) instance. This is
  typically much faster than relocating replicas one by one.
  Orchestrator chooses the best course of action to relocation the replicas. It may choose a multi-step operations.
  Some replicas may succeed and some may fail the operation.
  The instance (replicas' main) itself may be crashed or inaccessible. It is not contacted throughout the operation.
  Examples:

  orchestrator -c relocate-replicas -i instance.whose.replicas.will.relocate -d instance.that.becomes.their.main

  orchestrator -c relocate-replicas -i instance.whose.replicas.will.relocate -d instance.that.becomes.their.main --pattern=regexp.filter

  `
	CommandHelp["move-up-replicas"] = `
  Moves replicas of the given instance one level up the topology, making them siblings of given instance.
  This is a (faster) shortcut to executing move-up on all replicas of given instance.
  Examples:

  orchestrator -c move-up-replicas -i replica.whose.subreplicas.will.move.up.com[:3306]

  orchestrator -c move-up-replicas -i replica.whose.subreplicas.will.move.up.com[:3306] --pattern=regexp.filter
      only apply to those instances that match given regex
	`
	CommandHelp["move-below"] = `
  Moves a replica beneath its sibling. Both replicas must be actively replicating from same main.
  The sibling will become instance's main. No action taken when sibling cannot act as main
  (e.g. has no binary logs, is of incompatible version, incompatible binlog format etc.)
  Example:

  orchestrator -c move-below -i replica.to.move.com -d sibling.replica.under.which.to.move.com

  orchestrator -c move-below -d sibling.replica.under.which.to.move.com
      -i not given, implicitly assumed local hostname
	`
	CommandHelp["move-equivalent"] = `
  Moves a replica beneath another server, based on previously recorded "equivalence coordinates". Such coordinates
  are obtained whenever orchestrator issues a CHANGE MASTER TO. The "before" and "after" mains coordinates are
  persisted. In such cases where the newly relocated replica is unable to replicate (e.g. firewall issues) it is then
  easy to revert the relocation via "move-equivalent".
  The command works if and only if orchestrator has an exact mapping between the replica's current replication coordinates
  and some other coordinates.
  Example:

  orchestrator -c move-equivalent -i replica.to.revert.main.position.com -d main.to.move.to.com

	CommandHelp["take-siblings"] = `
  Turn all siblings of a replica into its sub-replicas. No action taken for siblings that cannot become
  replicas of given instance (e.g. incompatible versions, binlog format etc.). This is a (faster) shortcut
  to executing move-below for all siblings of the given instance. Example:

  orchestrator -c take-siblings -i replica.whose.siblings.will.move.below.com
	`
	CommandHelp["take-main"] = `
  Turn an instance into a main of its own main; essentially switch the two. Replicas of each of the two
  involved instances are unaffected, and continue to replicate as they were.
  The instance's main must itself be a replica. It does not necessarily have to be actively replicating.

  orchestrator -c take-main -i replica.that.will.switch.places.with.its.main.com
	`
	CommandHelp["repoint"] = `
  Make the given instance replicate from another instance without changing the binglog coordinates. There
  are little sanity checks to this and this is a risky operation. Use cases are: a rename of the main's
  host, a corruption in relay-logs, move from beneath MaxScale & Binlog-server. Examples:

  orchestrator -c repoint -i replica.to.operate.on.com -d new.main.com

  orchestrator -c repoint -i replica.to.operate.on.com
      The above will repoint the replica back to its existing main without change

  orchestrator -c repoint
      -i not given, implicitly assumed local hostname
	`
	CommandHelp["repoint-replicas"] = `
  Repoint all replicas of given instance to replicate back from the instance. This is a convenience method

  Create a main-main replication. Given instance is a replica which replicates directly from a main.
  The main is then turned to be a replica of the instance. The main is expected to not be a replica.
  The read_only property of the slve is unaffected by this operation. Examples:

  orchestrator -c make-co-main -i replica.to.turn.into.co.main.com

  orchestrator -c make-co-main

	CommandHelp["get-candidate-replica"] = `
  Information command suggesting the most up-to-date replica of a given instance, which can be promoted
  as local main to its siblings. If replication is up and running, this command merely gives an
  estimate, since replicas advance and progress continuously in different pace. If all replicas of given
  instance have broken replication (e.g. because given instance is dead), then this command provides
  with a definitve candidate, which could act as a replace main. See also regroup-replicas. Example:

  orchestrator -c get-candidate-replica -i instance.with.replicas.one.of.which.may.be.candidate.com

	CommandHelp["regroup-replicas-bls"] = `
  Given an instance that has Binlog Servers for replicas, promote one such Binlog Server over its other

  --debug is your friend.
	`
	CommandHelp["move-gtid"] = `
  Move a replica beneath another (destination) instance. Orchestrator will reject the operation if GTID is
  not enabled on the replica, or is not supported by the would-be main.
  You may try and move the replica under any other instance; there are no constraints on the family ties the
  two may have, though you should be careful as not to try and replicate from a descendant (making an
  impossible loop).
  Examples:

  orchestrator -c move-gtid -i replica.to.move.com -d instance.that.becomes.its.main

  orchestrator -c match -d destination.instance.that.becomes.its.main
      -i not given, implicitly assumed local hostname
	`
	CommandHelp["move-replicas-gtid"] = `
  Moves all replicas of a given instance under another (destination) instance using GTID. This is a (faster)
  shortcut to moving each replica via "move-gtid".
  Orchestrator will only move those replica configured with GTID (either Oracle or MariaDB variants) and under the
  condition the would-be main supports GTID.
  Examples:

  orchestrator -c move-replicas-gtid -i instance.whose.replicas.will.relocate -d instance.that.becomes.their.main

  orchestrator -c move-replicas-gtid -i instance.whose.replicas.will.relocate -d instance.that.becomes.their.main --pattern=regexp.filter
      only apply to those instances that match given regex
	`
	CommandHelp["regroup-replicas-gtid"] = `
  Given an instance (possibly a crashed one; it is never being accessed), pick one of its replica and make it
  local main of its siblings, using GTID. The rules are similar to those in the "regroup-replicas" command.
  Example:

  orchestrator -c regroup-replicas-gtid -i instance.with.gtid.and.replicas.one.of.which.will.turn.local.main.if.possible

  --debug is your friend.

	CommandHelp["match"] = `
  Matches a replica beneath another (destination) instance. The choice of destination is almost arbitrary;
  it must not be a child/descendant of the instance. But otherwise they don't have to be direct siblings,
  and in fact (if you know what you're doing), they don't actually have to belong to the same topology.
  The operation expects the relocated instance to be "behind" the destination instance. It only finds out
  whether this is the case by the end; the operation is cancelled in the event this is not the case.
  No action taken when destination instance cannot act as main (e.g. has no binary logs, is of incompatible version, incompatible binlog format etc.)
  Examples:

  orchestrator -c match -i replica.to.relocate.com -d instance.that.becomes.its.main

  orchestrator -c match -d destination.instance.that.becomes.its.main
      -i not given, implicitly assumed local hostname

  (this command was previously named "match-below")
	`
	CommandHelp["match-replicas"] = `
  Matches all replicas of a given instance under another (destination) instance. This is a (faster) shortcut
  to matching said replicas one by one under the destination instance. In fact, this bulk operation is highly
  optimized and can execute in orders of magnitue faster, depeding on the nu,ber of replicas involved and their
  respective position behind the instance (the more replicas, the more savings).
  The instance itself may be crashed or inaccessible. It is not contacted throughout the operation. Examples:

  orchestrator -c match-replicas -i instance.whose.replicas.will.relocate -d instance.that.becomes.their.main

  orchestrator -c match-replicas -i instance.whose.replicas.will.relocate -d instance.that.becomes.their.main --pattern=regexp.filter
      only apply to those instances that match given regex

  (this command was previously named "multi-match-replicas")
	`
	CommandHelp["match-up"] = `
  Transport the replica one level up the hierarchy, making it child of its grandparent. This is
  similar in essence to move-up, only based on Pseudo-GTID. The main of the given instance
  does not need to be alive or connected (and could in fact be crashed). It is never contacted.
  Grandparent instance must be alive and accessible.
  Examples:

  orchestrator -c match-up -i replica.to.match.up.com:3306

  orchestrator -c match-up
      -i not given, implicitly assumed local hostname
	`
	CommandHelp["match-up-replicas"] = `
  Matches replicas of the given instance one level up the topology, making them siblings of given instance.
  This is a (faster) shortcut to executing match-up on all replicas of given instance. The instance need
  not be alive / accessib;e / functional. It can be crashed.
  Example:

  orchestrator -c match-up-replicas -i replica.whose.subreplicas.will.match.up.com

  orchestrator -c match-up-replicas -i replica.whose.subreplicas.will.match.up.com[:3306] --pattern=regexp.filter
      only apply to those instances that match given regex
	`
	CommandHelp["rematch"] = `
  Reconnect a replica onto its main, via PSeudo-GTID. The use case for this operation is a non-crash-safe
  replication configuration (e.g. MySQL 5.5) with sync_binlog=1 and log_subordinate_updates. This operation
  implies crash-safe-replication and makes it possible for the replica to reconnect. Example:

  orchestrator -c rematch -i replica.to.rematch.under.its.main
	`
	CommandHelp["regroup-replicas"] = `
  Given an instance (possibly a crashed one; it is never being accessed), pick one of its replica and make it
  local main of its siblings, using Pseudo-GTID. It is uncertain that there *is* a replica that will be able to
  become main to all its siblings. But if there is one, orchestrator will pick such one. There are many
  constraints, most notably the replication positions of all replicas, whether they use log_subordinate_updates, and
  otherwise version compatabilities etc.
  As many replicas that can be regrouped under promoted slves are operated on. The rest are untouched.
  This command is useful in the event of a crash. For example, in the event that a main dies, this operation
  can promote a candidate replacement and set up the remaining topology to correctly replicate from that
  replacement replica. Example:

  orchestrator -c regroup-replicas -i instance.with.replicas.one.of.which.will.turn.local.main.if.possible

  --debug is your friend.

	CommandHelp["enable-gtid"] = `
  If possible, enable GTID replication. This works on Oracle (>= 5.6, gtid-mode=1) and MariaDB (>= 10.0).
  Replication is stopped for a short duration so as to reconfigure as GTID. In case of error replication remains
  stopped. Example:

  orchestrator -c enable-gtid -i replica.compatible.with.gtid.com

  Assuming GTID is enabled, Reset main on instance, remove GTID entries generated by the instance.
  This operation is only allowed on Oracle-GTID enabled servers that have no replicas.
  Is is used for cleaning up the GTID mess incurred by mistakenly issuing queries on the replica (even such
  queries as "FLUSH ENGINE LOGS" that happen to write to binary logs). Example:

  orchestrator -c reset-main-gtid-remove-own-uuid -i replica.running.with.gtid.com

  This will search the instance's binary logs starting with most recent, and terminate as soon as an exact match is found.
  The given input is not a regular expression. It must fully match the entry (not a substring).
  This is most useful when looking for uniquely identifyable values, such as Pseudo-GTID. Example:

  orchestrator -c find-binlog-entry -i instance.to.search.on.com --pattern "insert into my_data (my_column) values ('distinct_value_01234_56789')"

  Given an instance (-i) and binlog coordinates (--binlog=file:pos), find the correlated coordinates in another instance (-d).
  "Correlated coordinates" are those that present the same point-in-time of sequence of binary log events, untangling
  the mess of different binlog file:pos coordinates on different servers.
  This operation relies on Pseudo-GTID: your servers must have been pre-injected with PSeudo-GTID entries as these are
  being used as binlog markers in the correlation process.
  You must provide a valid file:pos in the binlogs of the source instance (-i), and in response get the correlated
  coordinates in the binlogs of the destination instance (-d). This operation does not work on relay logs.
  Example:

  orchestrator -c correlate-binlog-pos  -i instance.with.binary.log.com --binlog=mysql-bin.002366:14127 -d other.instance.with.binary.logs.com

  For a given cluster (indicated by an instance or alias), output a heuristic "representative" lag of that cluster.
  The output is obtained by examining the replicas that are member of "which-cluster-osc-replicas"-command, and
  getting the maximum replica lag of those replicas. Recall that those replicas are a subset of the entire cluster,
  and that they are ebing polled periodically. Hence the output of this command is not necessarily up-to-date
  and does not represent all replicas in cluster. Examples:

  orchestrator -c get-cluster-heuristic-lag -i instance.that.is.part.of.cluster.com

  orchestrator -c get-cluster-heuristic-lag
      -i not given, implicitly assumed local host, cluster implied

	CommandHelp["snapshot-topologies"] = `
  Take a snapshot of existing topologies. This will record minimal replication topology data: the identity

  Taking a snapshot later allows for reviewing changes in topologies. One might wish to invoke this command
  on a daily basis, and later be able to solve questions like 'where was this instacne replicating from before
  we moved it?', 'which instances were replication from this instance a week ago?' etc. Example:

  orchestrator -c snapshot-topologies

	CommandHelp["discover"] = `
  Request that orchestrator cotacts given instance, reads its status, and upsert it into

  orchestrator -c discover -i instance.to.discover.com:3306

  orchestrator -c discover -i cname.of.instance

  orchestrator -c discover
      -i not given, implicitly assumed local hostname

  Orchestrator will resolve CNAMEs and VIPs.

	CommandHelp["forget"] = `
  Request that orchestrator removed given instance from its repository. If the instance is alive
  and connected through replication to otherwise known and live instances, orchestrator will
  re-discover it by nature of its discovery process. Instances are auto-removed via config's
  UnseenAgentForgetHours. If you happen to know a machine is decommisioned, for example, it
  can be nice to remove it from the repository before it auto-expires. Example:

  orchestrator -c forget -i instance.to.forget.com

  Orchestrator will *not* resolve CNAMEs and VIPs for given instance.

	CommandHelp["begin-maintenance"] = `
  Request a maintenance lock on an instance. Topology changes require placing locks on the minimal set of
  affected instances, so as to avoid an incident of two uncoordinated operations on a smae instance (leading
  to possible chaos). Locks are placed in the backend database, and so multiple orchestrator instances are safe.
  Operations automatically acquire locks and release them. This command manually acquires a lock, and will
  block other operations on the instance until lock is released.
  Note that orchestrator automatically assumes locks to be expired after MaintenanceExpireMinutes (hard coded value).
  Examples:

  orchestrator -c begin-maintenance -i instance.to.lock.com --duration=3h --reason="load testing; do not disturb"
      accepted duration format: 10s, 30m, 24h, 3d, 4w

	`
	CommandHelp["end-maintenance"] = `
  Remove maintenance lock; such lock may have been gained by an explicit begin-maintenance command implicitly
  by a topology change. You should generally only remove locks you have placed manually; orchestrator will
  automatically expire locks after MaintenanceExpireMinutes (hard coded value).
  Example:

  orchestrator -c end-maintenance -i locked.instance.com

	CommandHelp["begin-downtime"] = `
  Mark an instance as downtimed. A downtimed instance is assumed to be taken care of, and recovery-analysis does
  not apply for such an instance. As result, no recommendation for recovery, and no automated-recovery are issued
  on a downtimed instance.
  Downtime is different than maintanence in that it places no lock (mainenance uses an exclusive lock on the instance).
  It is OK to downtime an instance that is already downtimed -- the new begin-downtime command will override whatever
  previous downtime attributes there were on downtimes instance.
  Note that orchestrator automatically assumes downtime to be expired after MaintenanceExpireMinutes (hard coded value).
  Examples:

  orchestrator -c begin-downtime -i instance.to.downtime.com --duration=3h --reason="dba handling; do not do recovery"
      accepted duration format: 10s, 30m, 24h, 3d, 4w

	CommandHelp["end-downtime"] = `
  Indicate an instance is no longer downtimed. Typically you should not need to use this since
  a downtime is always bounded by a duration and auto-expires. But you may use this to forcibly
  indicate the active downtime should be expired now.
  Example:

  orchestrator -c end-downtime -i downtimed.instance.com

	`
	CommandHelp["force-main-takeover"] = `
	Forcibly discard main and promote another (direct child) instance instead, even if everything is running well.

	NOTE:
	- You must specify the instance to promote via "-d"
	- Promoted instance must be a direct child of the existing main
	- This will not work in a main-main configuration
	- Orchestrator just treats this command as a DeadMain failover scenario
	- It is STRONGLY suggested that you first relocate everything below your chosen instance-to-promote.

	- Otherwise orchestrator will do its thing in moving instances around, hopefully promoting your requested
	  server on top.
	- Orchestrator will issue all relevant pre-failover and post-failover external processes.
	- In this command orchestrator will not issue 'SET GLOBAL read_only=1' on the existing main, nor will
	  it issue a 'FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK'. Please see the 'graceful-main-takeover' command.
	Examples:

	orchestrator -c force-main-takeover -alias mycluster -d immediate.child.of.main.com

	orchestrator -c force-main-takeover -i instance.in.relevant.cluster.com -d immediate.child.of.main.com

	- Orchestrator then proceeds to handle a DeadMain failover scenario
	- Orchestrator will issue all relevant pre-failover and post-failover external processes.

	CommandHelp["register-candidate"] = `
  Indicate that a specific instance is a preferred candidate for main promotion. Upon a dead main
  recovery, orchestrator will do its best to promote instances that are marked as candidates. However
  orchestrator cannot guarantee this will always work. Issues like version compatabilities, binlog format
  etc. are limiting factors.
  You will want to mark an instance as a candidate when: it is replicating directly from the main, has
  binary logs and log_subordinate_updates is enabled, uses same binlog_format as its siblings, compatible version
  as its siblings. If you're using DataCenterPattern & PhysicalEnvironmentPattern (see configuration),
  you would further wish to make sure you have a candidate in each data center.
  Orchestrator first promotes the best-possible replica, and only then replaces it with your candidate,
  and only if both in same datcenter and physical enviroment.
  An instance needs to continuously be marked as candidate, so as to make sure orchestrator is not wasting
  time with stale instances. Orchestrator periodically clears candidate-registration for instances that have
  not been registeres for over CandidateInstanceExpireMinutes (see config).
  Example:

  orchestrator -c register-candidate -i candidate.instance.com

  orchestrator -c register-candidate
      -i not given, implicitly assumed local hostname
	`
	CommandHelp["register-hostname-unresolve"] = `
  Assigns the given instance a virtual (aka "unresolved") name. When moving replicas under an instance with assigned
  "unresolve" name, orchestrator issues a CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='<the unresovled name instead of the fqdn>' ...
  This is useful in cases where your main is behind virtual IP (e.g. active/passive mains with shared storage or DRBD,
  e.g. binlog servers sharing common VIP).
  A "repoint" command is useful after "register-hostname-unresolve": you can repoint replicas of the instance to their exact
  same location, and orchestrator will swap the fqdn of their main with the unresolved name.
  Such registration must be periodic. Orchestrator automatically expires such registration after ExpiryHostnameResolvesMinutes.
  Example:

  orchestrator -c register-hostname-unresolve -i instance.fqdn.com --hostname=virtual.name.com
	`
	CommandHelp["deregister-hostname-unresolve"] = `
  Explicitly deregister/dosassociate a hostname with an "unresolved" name. Orchestrator merely remvoes the association, but does
  not touch any replica at this point. A "repoint" command can be useful right after calling this command to change replica's main host
  name (assumed to be an "unresolved" name, such as a VIP) with the real fqdn of the main host.
  Example:

  orchestrator -c deregister-hostname-unresolve -i instance.fqdn.com

	CommandHelp["set-heuristic-domain-instance"] = `
	This is a temporary (sync your watches, watch for next ice age) command which registers the cluster domain name of a given cluster
	with the main/writer host for that cluster. It is a one-time-main-discovery operation.
	At this time orchestrator may also act as a small & simple key-value store (recall the "temporary" indication).
	Main failover operations will overwrite the domain instance identity. Orchestrator so turns into a mini main-discovery
	service (I said "TEMPORARY"). Really there are other tools for the job. See also: which-heuristic-domain-instance
	Example:

	orchestrator -c set-heuristic-domain-instance --alias some_alias
			Detects the domain name for given cluster, identifies the writer main of the cluster, associates the two in key-value store

	orchestrator -c set-heuristic-domain-instance -i instance.of.some.cluster
